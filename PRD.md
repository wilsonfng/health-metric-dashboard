# Health Metric Dashboard - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Health Metric Dashboard  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 2024  
**Status:** In Development  

## Executive Summary

This project aims to create a customizable, interactive health metric dashboard application that allows users to visualize and configure health parameters with draggable range controls. The dashboard will display various health metrics with color-coded ranges (Red/Yellow/Green) and provide intuitive controls for adjusting threshold values.

## Problem Statement

Healthcare professionals and individuals need a simple, visual way to:
- Monitor multiple health metrics simultaneously
- Understand normal vs. abnormal ranges for different health parameters
- Customize threshold values based on individual needs or medical guidelines
- Have an intuitive interface that works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Solution Overview

A web-based dashboard that displays health metrics as horizontal bars with:
- Color-coded segments representing different health ranges (Critical/Cautionary/Healthy)
- Draggable handles for adjusting threshold boundaries
- Manual input fields for precise value entry
- Real-time validation and feedback
- Responsive design for all device types

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

1. **Health Metrics Display**
   - Display 9 predefined health metrics (see list below)
   - Each metric shown as a horizontal bar with color-coded segments

   - Show current threshold values on each handle

2. **Interactive Controls**
   - Draggable handles on each threshold boundary
   - Manual input fields for precise value entry
   - Real-time synchronization between dragging and input
   - Visual feedback during interactions

3. **Validation & Constraints**
   - Thresholds cannot cross each other
   - Values must stay within defined min/max bounds
   - Real-time error messages for invalid inputs
   - Visual indicators (red borders) for errors

4. **Data Persistence**
   - Save custom configurations to browser localStorage
   - Restore settings on page reload
   - Reset to default values option

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Touch-friendly controls for mobile devices
   - Adaptive layout for different screen sizes

### Health Metrics Included

1. **Systolic Pressure** (mmHg) - Range: 0-200
2. **Diastolic Pressure** (mmHg) - Range: 0-130  
3. **Pulse** (bpm) - Range: 0-150
4. **O2 Saturation** (%) - Range: 0-100
5. **Fasting Glucose** (mg/dL) - Range: 0-200
6. **Glucose After Breakfast** (mg/dL) - Range: 0-200
7. **Glucose Before Lunch** (mg/dL) - Range: 0-200
8. **Glucose After Lunch** (mg/dL) - Range: 0-200
9. **Glucose Before Dinner** (mg/dL) - Range: 0-200

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

1. **As a healthcare professional**, I want to view multiple health metrics at once so that I can quickly assess a patient's overall health status.

2. **As a user**, I want to drag handles to adjust threshold values so that I can customize ranges based on individual needs.

3. **As a user**, I want to enter precise values in input fields so that I can set exact threshold numbers.

4. **As a mobile user**, I want to use touch gestures to adjust thresholds so that I can use the dashboard on my phone or tablet.

5. **As a user**, I want my custom settings to be saved automatically so that I don't lose my configuration when I reload the page.

### Secondary User Stories

6. **As a user**, I want to see error messages when I enter invalid values so that I understand what went wrong.

7. **As a user**, I want to reset to default values so that I can start over if I make mistakes.

8. **As a user with accessibility needs**, I want to navigate the dashboard using only my keyboard so that I can use assistive technologies.
